This is a Twitter Bootstrap (or plain CSS)-compatible jQuery calendar plugin. It can be configured to display either as a small widget, or display as a large grid for showing appointments and whatnot.

The calendar is customisable with CSS and is able to use Twitter Bootstrap's styles. **It will also happily fall back to default styles if Bootstrap is not used.**

Events can be bound to various events, such as `monthChange` and `daySelect` to fire off AJAX requests or other custom functionality.
